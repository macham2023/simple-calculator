#ABOUT THE SIMPLE CALCULATOR

The calculator performs the following arithmetic operarions:
1. Addition.
2. Subtraction.
3. Multiplication.
4. Division.
5. Exponentiation.
6. Floor Division

  Basicalyy, the calculator prompts the user to enter a first number and stores it in a variable named 'first_number' and second number in a variable named 'second_number'. It performs the operation and store the result in another variable and prints the result as a float.


  THE ADDITION OPERATOR (+):
It sums the value of first_number and second_number and prints the result as float.



 THE SUBTRACTION OPERATOR (-):
It subtracts the value of second_number from the value of first number.




  THE MULTIPLICATION OPERATOR (*):
The value of first_number is multiplied by the value of second_number.




  THE DIVISION OPERATOR (/):
It divides the value of first_number by value of second_number and returns the result as float.




  THE EXPONENTIATION OPERATOR (**):
Also known as 'raise to the power'. It  takes the value of first_number and multiplies it by the value of second_number.




  THE FLOOR DIVISION OPERATOR (//)
It divides the value of second_number by the value of first_number and rounds the result to the lowest integer.Floor division always returns an integer( without decimal point or float).
